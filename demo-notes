Why me?

I've had to force myself to pair with lots of different for the last
five years. Pairing is the best way to learn the ecosystem, but also new
development practices. If I didn't learn, I couldn't do my job.

First pairing experience:
* good friends
* both have been developing solo some time
* each wanted to go its own way
* got nothing done on day 1
* exhausted

Basic Rules of the Road
* two drivers
* two keyboards (or laptop and keyboard)
* two monitors
* "What do you want me to type"
* something concrete to work on
* (picture of Chris here)

  Two Drivers
    * multiple keyboards
    * multiple monitors
    * you don't need to extend display on two monitors when pairing
      * mirror displays instead
      * nice setup for mac when you open the laptop it remembers your settings

    What does this ^ mean?
      * you are not king
      * workstation is not your castle
      * give up your super-customized dev environment

Rules of the Road
* keep your eyes on the road
  * no twitter
  * no email
  * absolutely no Facebook
* important phone calls OK, but let your pair know

Other Tips
* do not pair on trivial things
* for research ok to get two laptops, but then put one away
* do not neglect hygiene - disrespectful
* periodic breaks

What to do when:
1. You don't get any space
   * practice the art of encroachment
   * inch in a little by litte, but do it loudly
     * if they hear you, they will move
   * put your arms on the desk

2. It's been two hours and you got nothing done
  * Stop talking so much. Pick one way and just do it
  * STOP REFACTORING! Get stuff working, then refactor
  Watch out for:
  * all talk, no code
    * maybe you shouldn't be working on story
    * maybe you should just pick one
